# slide puzzle

This is a 3x3 slide puzzle game made in Flutter. The finished and starting positions are the numbered tiles in ascending order. The tiles are buttons in a GridView widget. A numbered tile will switch positions with a blank tile (and vice versa) when clicked, in any order, in succession. The initial tile is highlighted at the beginning of this action.
