# slide puzzle

A 3x3 slide puzzle game made in UI software development framework Flutter, and written in Dart. The web release deployed on [my GitHub Pages](https://rissadr.github.io/projects/flutter/slidepuzzle/) The web build can be found in the `web` branch and the android build can be found in the `android` branch.

A tutorial/process of how the puzzle game was made is detailed in this video series on my [drcode YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSlcxI1BcpOqjmMZKoLasrZygqwFqaKbR)
